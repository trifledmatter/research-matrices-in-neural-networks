# Rust Implementation of Pre-Calculus Matrices in Neural Networks

## Introduction

This project is a result of an in-depth exploration into the integration of pre-calculus concepts, with a strong emphasis on `matrices`, within the domain of `neural networks`. As a part of a research project, the primary goal was to implement a neural network in Rust, leveraging matrices for various operations, and gaining a profound understanding of their fundamental role in machine learning.

## Mathematical Foundations

The project heavily relies on `matrix` operations, a fundamental aspect of linear algebra, within the context of `neural networks`. Understanding `matrices` is crucial for comprehending essential operations like forward and backward propagation, underlining the pivotal role of pre-calculus knowledge.

## Research Objective

This project was conducted as part of a quick research aimed at looking deeper into the practical implementation of `matrices` in `neural networks`. It sought to broaden the understanding of `matrix manipulation`, `activation functions`, and `backpropagation` within the `neural network` context. The research's primary objective was to gain more knowledge and skills within the topic, establishing a seamless connection between newfound pre-calculus principles and the intricacies of modern machine learning.
